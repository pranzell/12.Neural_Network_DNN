12. Neural Networks - DNN

This repository dives into the basics of a Deep/Dense Neural Netowrk. It contains an example of building a DNN model from Scratch and also contains an example which uses a KERAS API call. 

The example contains Energy Efficiency Example which has 8 inputs and 2 output responses.
